# Setting up a CI/CD pipeline by integrating Jenkins with AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodeDeploy

Jenkins, an open-source automation server, is used to deploy artifacts generated by AWS CodeBuild using AWS CodeDeploy, forming a robust CI/CD pipeline. When properly set up, this pipeline is triggered by code changes pushed to your GitHub repository, automatically passing them to CodeBuild for compilation, and subsequently deploying the output through CodeDeploy.

This process creates a fully managed build service that compiles your source code and produces deployable artifacts, which CodeDeploy then uses to automatically update your production environment.
